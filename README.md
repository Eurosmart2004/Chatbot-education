# Education Chatbot Project

This project aims to revolutionize the way we learn and teach. Our chatbot uses the state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique and Langchain to provide accurate and reliable information.

## Demo

### Courses Integrated

Our chatbot leverages content from the following courses at Swinburne University:

- **COS30019 - Introduction to AI**: This course covers the fundamentals of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. Our chatbot uses this knowledge to provide insightful responses and educational resources.
- **COS30043 - Interface Design and Development**: This course focuses on the principles of designing and developing user interfaces and user experience, with a specific emphasis on teaching Vue.js, a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
