# Education Chatbot Project

This project aims to revolutionize the way we learn and teach. Our chatbot uses the state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique and Langchain to provide accurate and reliable information.

## Features

- RAG Technique: Our chatbot uses the state-of-the-art RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technique to provide accurate and reliable information.
- Langchain: We use Langchain for efficient language processing.
- Video resources: Our chatbot supports students by supplying video resources to enhance their learning experience.
- User uploads: We believe in the power of community and collective knowledge. That's why we've integrated a feature that allows users to upload their own knowledge. This way, we can continuously grow and diversify our course offerings.
